                        <h2>Battle of Dagorlad</h2>
                        <p>The battle took place in the year SA 3434. It was fought between the army of the Last Alliance under Gil-galad and Elendil against an army of Orcs and other creatures loyal to Sauron, on the plains of Dagorlad just outside Mordor between Emyn Muil and Cirith Gorgor. The Last Alliance joined with Anárion's army from Gondor, which was holding Osgiliath and Minas Ithil, and they marched to Dagorlad. Oropher and Amdír, Sindar Elves, chafing under the command of the Ñoldorin Gil-galad, prematurely charged at the enemy and were driven back, and Amdír along with many Galadhrim Warriors died in the Dead Marshes.</p>

                        <p>Eventually, the Alliance was able to drive back the enemy forces and win the battle, proceeding then to attack the Black Gate and advance into Udûn. </p>

                        <h2>Weathertop Defend</h2>
                        <p>The Weather Hills lay at the center of the realm of Arnor, near the East-West Road that split Eriador.</p>

                        <p>The strategic importance of Weathertop was recognized very early on, as during the reign of Elendil, the Dúnedain of Arnor built a great watch-tower on its summit. It is said that in SA 3431, before the War of the Last Alliance, Elendil stood on the hill watching the hosts of Gil-galad making their way to join his forces in an alliance against Sauron.</p>

                        <p>In TA 861, after King Eärendur passed away and Arnor was divided into Arthedain, Cardolan, and Rhudaur, Weathertop stood at the junction of their borders, and was desired by all three of his sons, though they desired the palantír in the watch-tower rather than the hill itself. Nonetheless, Weathertop became the focus of a long-running territorial dispute between the three kingdoms, with frequent border skirmishes and minor wars. During this time, Weathertop may have changed hands on several occasions.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="scene-text">
                        <h2>Attack at Amon Hen</h2>
                        <p>Frodo was given an hour alone to decide how the Fellowship would proceed in their quest. However, after an hour had long past, Frodo had still not returned. Boromir, who had earlier abandoned the remaining members of the Fellowship without their knowing, then returned. He recounted that he had seen Frodo an hour before, that he had tried to convince Frodo to bring the Ring to Minas Tirith, and that they then had an argument, resulting in Frodo putting on the Ring and vanishing. This story roused the suspicions of Aragorn II, who guessed correctly that Boromir had not told the entire truth. At the conclusion of Boromir's story, Merry and Pippin immediately ran off to locate Frodo while Legolas and Gimli searched for the Ring-bearer in a different direction.</p>

                        <p>Fearing that the Fellowship would be scattered and lost, Aragorn commanded Boromir to follow Merry and Pippin. Aragorn then instructed Sam to follow him to the Seat of Seeing, but Sam was unable to keep up with him. Thinking on his feet, Sam returned to camp and saw a boat seemingly push itself into Nen Hithoel. Realizing that an invisible Frodo was pushing the boat, Sam caught up to Frodo, and convinced him to let him accompany him to Mordor.</p>

                        <p>Meanwhile, Aragorn, who had reached the Seat of Seeing, heard the sounds of Orcs and of Boromir blowing his horn. He ran to Boromir's aid, but arrived too late, as did the battle-worn Legolas and Gimli shortly thereafter. Boromir fought valiantly, redeeming himself for trying to steal the Ring from Frodo, but fell to many arrows allowing Merry and Pippin to be captured. With Frodo and Sam heading off to Mordor on their own, Aragorn decided that the fate of the Ring was no longer in their hands, so he, Legolas, and Gimli set out to rescue Merry and Pippin.</p>

                        <h2>Battle of the Peak</h2>
                        <p>After their fight at the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, Gandalf and the Balrog both fell into the deep chasm. Gandalf was burned by the Balrog's fire on the way down, then almost froze in the water at the bottom. He pursued his foe for days through dark tunnels, and then all the way up the Endless Stair to the top of Durin's Tower in the living rock of Zirakzigil, where the two engaged in a two-day long battle at the pinnacle of the Silvertine above the clouds. They fought in a narrow space upon Celebdil, above the mists of the world. The sun shone fiercely, but all below was wrapped in cloud, so that anyone watching from below would think they saw flashes from lightning and heard thunder. A great smoke of vapor and steam rose about them, and ice fell like rain.</p>

                        <p>There they fought until at last Gandalf threw down his enemy, and the Balrog broke the mountain-side as it fell. Then darkness took Gandalf, and he passed away. The battle had left Durin's Tower in ruins and caused the destruction of the Endless Stair. The entire battle, from the confrontation on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm to the mutual demise of the Balrog and Gandalf, had taken ten days.</p>

                    <div class="scene-text">
                        <h2>Saruman's Betrayal</h2>
                        <p>Motivated by both his master's instructions and thoughts of his own dominion, the White Wizard made the final preparations for the conquest of Rohan. Aided by his Orcs, Saruman slowly turned Nan Curunír into "a child's model or a slave's flattery" of Mordor:[11] trees were cut down and replaced by caverns filled with forges, furnaces and other machines. Around TA 3000, "the shadow of Mordor reached out to Rohan" and Saruman sent many of his Uruk-hai to join the Northern Orcs and the Mordor-orcs in raiding the eastern villages. To further weaken the kingdom, Saruman bought Gríma Wormtongue, Théoden's royal counselor, with the promise of Éowyn's hand by TA 3014 and used him as a mole in the court of Edoras to sap the king's strength with deceitful advice and poisons. Suspecting a potential connection between the Ring and the Shire (based mostly on Gandalf's interest there), Saruman instructed his agents to infiltrate the Shire and keep tabs on the comings and goings of any important Hobbits. His dealings with Pipe-weed had also earned him allies among the Sackville-Baggins and Bracegirdle families, who owned many plantations.[10] Further trying to emulate his master, the White Wizard crafted his own lesser ring and similarly styled himself as "Ring-maker"</p>

                        <p>Commanded by Sauron, Saruman moved against Théoden to keep Rohan from riding to Gondor's aid. With Gríma preventing any military mobilization within the kingdom, Saruman sent large raiding forces to wreak havoc in the Westfold of Rohan. The only true obstacles to his invasion were Théoden's son and nephew, Théodred and Éomer respectively. As Wormtongue had failed to turn the two men against each other, the White Wizard tasked his servants to slay the king's heir at all costs. Per this special order, the warriors of Isengard engaged the defenders of Rohan at the Fords of Isen; the First Battle at the Fords of Isen ended in the death of Théodred followed by the retreat of Saruman's hordes. At the same time, the corrupted Wizard also tried to betray his master: he sent trusted warbands to hunt down the Fellowship and capture the Ring-bearer. Saruman's scouts, led by Uglúk, ambushed the company at Amon Hen, where they took Pippin and Merry captive, while also shooting Boromir "with many black-feathered arrows" when he tried to defend the Hobbits. Slowed on their way back to Isengard by conflict with Mordor-orcs sent by a suspicious Sauron, the Isengarders were slain on the eaves of Fangorn by Rohirrim led by Éomer. Gimli believed he had glimpsed Saruman at the site of the skirmish, presumably having hastened to claim the Ring from the Hobbits.</p>

                        <p class="video-description italic-text">Gandalf's arrival at the Helm's Deep</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="scene-text">
                        <h2>Battle of the Hornbug</h2>
                        <p>After being freed by Gandalf from Gríma Wormtongue's influence, Théoden rode for the Fords of Isen where Erkenbrand was battling Saruman's Orcs. As Théoden rode west, he met Ceorl, who informed him of Erkenbrand's defeat. Unable to meet Saruman's force head-on with his small force, Gandalf advised him to ride straight to the Hornburg where many of the people of Westfold were taking refuge in the Glittering Caves. A local captain called Gamling the Old led the garrison of about a thousand men. With the arrival of Théoden, the defenders' strength was just under three thousand men, allowing the defences to be fully manned.</p>

                        <p>The army of Saruman, ultimately consisting of Uruk-hai, Wild Men of Dunland, Orcs, and Half-orcs, was reinforced on the way to Hornburg, due to casualties in the Battles of the Fords of Isen. The army would arrive at the fortress at midnight on March 3.</p>

                        <p>The Orcs quickly overran the first defense of Helm's Dike, but sustained many losses to the rearguard, "filling up the dike to the top". After moving past the dike, the Orcs approached the fortress of the Hornburg and sent arrows into the fortress. However, they did not get any response. But when they got closer they were met with a volley of arrows and rocks which made them break ranks. The Orcs soon got close enough to Hornburg and attempted to break the gate down with tree trunks, but were scattered by a small attack team led by Aragorn II and Éomer from a postern-door that ran between the brink of the cliff and the wall of the Hornburg. After the team had driven back the Orcs with the ram, they retreated from the new assault upon the gate. While running back, two Orcs who had faked their deaths knocked Éomer to the ground. As Aragorn ran back to save him, a hidden Gimli hewed the Orcs' heads, saving Éomer and giving Gimli his first two kills to Legolas' twenty.</p>

                        <p>The attackers then raised hundreds of ladders to scale the Deeping Wall; the defenders threw down the ladders, but were attacked from behind by Orcs who had crawled through the culvert at the base of the Deeping Wall. Gimli and Gamling the Old with a unit of men from the Westfold attacked the Orcs who got through the hole. Gimli, after getting twenty-one kills to Legolas' twenty-four, helped block the culvert with stones, flooding the stream. Unfortunately, this blockage was destroyed along with a good portion of the Deeping Wall by Saruman's devilry; the Fire of Orthanc.</p>

                        <p>Just before dawn, Aragorn called for a parley at the gate and told the Orcs that they would die if they didn't surrender, but the Uruk-hai laughed at his threat and attempted to shoot Aragorn down, almost killing him. The Orcs then blasted open the gate, destroying the arch with the 'blasting-fire'. Suddenly, Théoden and Aragorn led a powerful cavalry charge out of the keep to the blasts of the great horn of Helm Hammerhand, followed by the defenders of the Hornburg, driving the Uruks away from the remains of the gate. At the same time, Éomer and Gimli with the company in the caves pushed the Orcs out of the Deep. The army of the Mark drove the enemy behind the Dike into the Deeping-coomb.</p>

                        <p>Just then, Gandalf on his horse Shadowfax arrived with Erkenbrand and a thousand-foot soldiers. They charged Sauraman's host, trapping them between Erkenbrand's army, Théoden's army, and a newly appeared forest of strange trees. The Dunlendings dropped their weapons and surrendered, while the Uruk-hai fled into the forest.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="scene-text">
                        <h2>Shelob</h2>
                        <p>At one point after being set free from Mordor, Gollum stumbled into her lair while attempting to escape the barren country. She caught him, but he survived the encounter by promising to bring her tastier meats than he.[3] Orcs of Cirith Ungol had seen him on several occasions and believed that he was too thin and wiry for Shelob to bother eating.</p>

                        <p>Gollum would attempt later to fulfil this promise by leading Frodo and Sam into her lair and abandoning them. His hope was that once Shelob finished eating the two hobbits, she would throw away the One Ring with the other parts of the hobbits that she could not eat, allowing Gollum to retrieve it. While being pursued, the two hobbits eventually stumbled upon a passageway that was too choked with Shelob's dark cobwebs to proceed. But, fortunately, Frodo's sword Sting, being of Elvish make, was able to slice through them. Using the Phial of Galadriel, they managed to at first fend her off. The light of Gil-Orestel, the Star of Eärendil, shone from the Phial, causing unbearable stabbing pain to Shelob's darkened senses, but she then returned to attack Frodo, poisoning him with her stinger in a surprise attack just as they reached the exit of the cave on the Mordor side. Her venom paralyzed Frodo, and she then wrapped him in her web. Sam assumed Frodo to be dead.</p>

                        <p>Sam then assaulted the creature using Sting and the Phial of Galadriel in order to rescue his master. In a pitched battle, Sam managed to stab one of her eyes and injure one of her legs. However, her hide was too thick and too layered with ages of corruptive mass for even the greatest mortal warrior to injure her,much less Sam. However, she eventually attempted to crush Sam with the mass of her abdomen, and when Sam held Sting with the blade pointed up at her, she incidentally impaled herself. While not even the greatest Man or Elf had the strength to pierce her hide, Shelob herself did possess such strength, and she forced Sting deep enough into her abdomen to cause genuine harm. The pain of this wound in combination with the pain of the Phial of Galadriel was enough that Sam was able to force her to retreat. None had ever wounded her so badly before.</p>

                        <p>It is not known if Shelob recovered from the battle or succumbed to her wounds, as it was said her fate would remain unknown to the people of Middle-earth. She is last mentioned, in The Lord of the Rings, when Sam put on the One Ring, and heard Shelob "bubbling" in her misery far away, as his sense of hearing was vastly improved by wearing the Ring.</p>

                        <h2>Battle of the Pelennor Fields</h2>
                        <p>The Battle of the Pelennor Fields was a battle for the city of Minas Tirith and ultimately Gondor, immediately following a large-scale siege of Minas Tirith by Sauron's Morgul-host. It was the greatest battle of the War of the Ring and indeed the largest of the entire Third Age. Major casualties resulted, including King Théoden and the Witch-king of Angmar.</p>

                        <p>Unknown to both Gondor and Mordor, the Drúedain secretly guided Théoden's army safely through the Drúadan Forest via an old, hidden road built by the Men of Gondor long ago, and forgotten by all save the Wild Men. This allowed the Rohirrim to circumvent the defenses of the enemy on the northern road and attack the forces of Mordor from the rear. Rohan was joined by men from Dunland who wished to journey to Minas Tirith to fight with Gondor against the Dark Lord. Due to the dismantling of the Rammas Echor, Sauron's forces could not mount a strong defense, and Théoden's forces quickly overran the northern half of the Pelennor Fields. However, after forcing the retreat of the Haradrim cavalry, they were halted by the appearance of the Witch-king. He mortally wounded Théoden, who was crushed by his own horse, Snowmane.</p>

                        <p>SAt that moment, Éowyn and Meriadoc Brandybuck rode up to face him. Éowyn killed the winged steed upon which he rode, and the Witch-king fell to the ground. He was unharmed by this, however, and he stood up menacingly, readying his mace. He swung at Éowyn, who managed to block the attack with her shield, which shattered under the great mace's force. Éowyn's arm was also shattered upon impact. She fell to the ground, and the Witch-king lifted his mace for a final blow. As he did so, Merry, who was behind him, stabbed him in the back of the leg with his Barrow-blade. The Witch-king was wounded, and Éowyn used this distraction to drive her sword into his face, killing him.</p>

                        <p>During this, and afterwards, the Dunlendings and Rohirrim (under the command of Éomer) continued their assault, while footmen of Gondor launched their own counterattack, sortieing from the gate while Imrahil, his Swan Knights, and Gondor's cavalry tried to reach Éomer. Even so, they were all outmatched by the Mûmakil and Haradrim as the enemy committed their reserves. As the tide of battle turned against Gondor, the Men of the West were dismayed to see the Corsairs of Umbar apparently arrive.</p>

                        <p>Neither side knew that Aragorn and the Grey Company, with the help of the Army of the Dead, had vanquished the fleet of the Corsairs in the Battle of Pelargir. The Army of the Dead repaid their debt to Isildur by driving the Corsairs upon the ships mad, causing them to jump overboard and drown. After loading the ships with as many men of southern Gondor as possible, they sailed north to the battle. Upon arriving, the enemy found itself in a disadvantageous position, with their enemies where (and when) they least expected. The extra reinforcements brought by Aragorn punched a wide salient within the most vulnerable area of the Mordor-host, severing the forces nearer to Minas Tirith and the ones close to the river Anduin. </p>

                        <h2>The Battle of the Morannon </h2>
                        <p>After the victory of the Free Peoples in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the enemy retreated to Mordor. Sauron was defeated but he still had thousands of Orcs and evil Men at his disposal in Mordor. He was aware that the One Ring was somewhat close to the vicinity of his territory, but he did not know that the Hobbit Frodo Baggins and his companion Samwise Gamgee had entered Mordor via the pass of Cirith Ungol with the intention of destroying the Ring.</p>

                        <p>After the Last Debate, the Men of the West assembled the Host of the West, 7,000 strong, led by Aragorn, who marched on the Black Gate as a diversionary feint to distract Sauron's attention from Frodo and Sam, who were carrying the One Ring through Mordor to be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom. It was hoped that Sauron would think Aragorn had the Ring and was now trying to use it to overthrow him in Mordor.</p>

                        <p>Initially, the Host of the West consisted of 7,000 men, but a strong force was left to guard the Cross-roads of the Fallen King. Part way through Ithilien the army was ambushed by Haradrim and Easterlings, but they were easily detected by the Rangers of Ithilien and driven off with few casualties.</p>

                        <p>Then, as the army approached Dagorlad, some of the farmers of Lossarnach and Rohan were too afraid to continue into the Desolation of the Morannon. Aragorn dismissed the faint-hearted, ordering them to liberate Cair Andros on the river Anduin, further reducing the strength of the army.</p>

                        <p>Before the battle began, the Black Gate opened slightly, letting out a small embassy. At the head was a high servant of Sauron, a Black Númenórean called the Mouth of Sauron, who had been ordered to speak with the Captains of the West. He reasoned that the Army of the West could not defeat Sauron's host on the battlefield, and demanded the Army surrender. The Lieutenant then brought forth several items that had belonged to Frodo and Sam (Sam's sword, an Elven cloak, and Frodo's Mithril Coat). Gandalf asked for the terms of their surrender, which were to allow Sauron dominion over Isengard and Rohan, as well as Gondor's vassalage. Gandalf vehemently refused.</p>
